### On Premise Srt Server

OnPremise SRT Server is a complete software and operating system solution, that converts a compliant computer, into a disruptive on premise multimedia gateway, able to repeat multiple inputs

to multiple outputs, as shown in the graph above (point-to-point and point-to-multipoint) Easily controlled from a web browser, from any network connected computer. You will build your

own contribution / distribution network in a few clicks, and control them 24/7 in realtime. Lock and unlock any individual component (input or output), attach a watchdog to any source to warn you

when the audio is gone, alerting about an issue in the source side.

### Below we list all of the features

- Input protocols: RTMP/S pull, RTSP pull, HTTP pull, HLS, DASH, UDP (unicast/multicast), SRT (caller/listener/rendezvous) - Output protocols: UDP(unicast/multicast), SRT(caller/listener/rendezvous), RTMP/S(Youtube,

Facebook, Twitch, Wowza and many more…) - UDP and SRT original Transport Streams, will be repeated exactly as they are, adding zero latency to them, and not changing a bit (nor remuxing). You can send both SPTS and MPTS

- UDP and SRT are codec and resolution agnostic, so they could transport MPEG-2, H.264, H.265/ HEVC, H.266/VVC or any other TS compliant codec, with any resolution: SDTV, HDTV, 4K, 8K.

- Control all of your TV/Radio network status at a glance (connected/disconnected, watchdog alarms, etc) - Remote access icon can be assigned to a remote http URL to control any element from the

same dashboard in a single click - You can erase and edit any element, and also re-assign any output to another input immediately - Backup and restore all of the components and settings into/from a JSON file

- Easily updated in a single click - DDNS for DynDNS and No-IP - IPv4 and IPv6 double stack - MDNS (Bonjour) integrated, to be quickly and easily discovered in your LAN

- UPnP to open any needed port in your internet gateway (routers compatible with libminiupnpc) - Based on Debian 10, the system is stable and safe enough to be in your DMZ zone

- Admin and user roles (user blocking facility) - API REST available and documented on Swagger 2.0 (build and upload your own branded frontend, or build an external App to control all the system)

- 1 month for FREE on every new hardware setup

### Hardware minimal requirements
